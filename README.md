  Good morning,

    My name is Raul J. Rivera, was very interesting do this project. My project basically has 5 .html pages (hello, facts, hobbies, schedule and form). All the pages have a hyperlink what makes it possible to go from one page to another page, a bootstrap link to make the pages beautiful and, a <meta> viewport element to control the page's dimensions and scaling in all devices.

     -Hello.html has my photo and a little description about me.
     -Facts.html has a bootstrap columns layout but I removed the script container
      and use a row to improve the appearance and, I add a bootstrap component card in each column, each card with an image, at the end I add a bootstrap component alert.  
     -Hobies.html has one list ordered and one list ordered, an image and a special
      list with an image in each sentence.
     -Schedule.html has a little comment about my favorite time of the day and
      table to show my availability in the week to practice coding.
     -Form.htm has a bootstrap columns layout with a container and a bootstrap
      component alert in each columns and a bottom to choose your preference, at the and a create a short section called "your opinion matters" where I create many boxes for collect user input like name, age, display a browser to choose, select your country from a 200 different countries and a bottom to submit the information.

    My project also has 4 stylesheet files in CSS a
    nd 2 stylesheets in sass, every sass file has a twin CSS file. Every CSS file has a lot of properties and selectors including #id and .class.
    In the stylesheet, style2.css I create a mobile-responsive@media query to show 2 different background and properties according to the size of the window.

    Finally, I use 2 stylesheets in SASS, sass_style3.scss and sass_style4.scss to be able to create variables, one nesting and an inheritance.

    Note: I use 9 imagens and there are a lot of properties like shadow, color inside the tables, inside the cards, padding, change color and font when you select text, change de color when the cursor are in top of the bottom submit, etc. I hope you enjoy this page as much as I did while I was creating it.
